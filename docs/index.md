# Trading Strategy Tester

Welcome to the documentation for the **Trading Strategy Tester** project. This project is designed to help you test and 
evaluate trading strategies using historical data. The goal is to provide a comprehensive framework that allows you to
simulate trades, analyze performance, and optimize strategies. The project also includes a user-friendly interface for
visualizing results and performance metrics.

The project is divided into two parts: the **Python package** and the **web application**. On this page you can find the documentation for both parts of the project.

Here you can find the documentation for the **Python package**. The documentation is organized into two sections:

- [Documentation for Users](user/index.md)
- [Documentation for Developers](dev/index.md)

Here you can find the Documentation for users for the **web application**.

- [Web Application Documentation](user/web_ui/main_page.md)

And the **Documentation for administrators** explaining how to run the application for both parts of the project:

- [Documentation for Administrators](admin/index.md)

## Large Language Models Integration

One of the main features of this project is the integration with Large Language Models to assist in generating and optimizing trading strategies. By leveraging the power of LLMs, users can create the strategies more efficiently and effectively. This section of the project has it's own documentation, which can be found [here](llm/index.md).
