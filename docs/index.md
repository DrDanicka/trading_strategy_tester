# Trading Strategy Tester

Welcome to the documentation for the **Trading Strategy Tester**. This project is designed to help you test and evaluate trading strategies using historical data. The goal is to provide a comprehensive framework that allows you to simulate trades, analyze performance, and optimize strategies.

One of the main features of this project is the integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in generating and optimizing trading strategies. By leveraging the power of LLMs, users can create the strategies more efficiently and effectively. The project also includes a user-friendly interface for visualizing results and performance metrics.

Here you can find the documentation for the Python package. The documentation is organized into two sections:

- [Developer Documentation](dev/index.md)
- [User Documentation](user/index.md)
