# `WILLR` â€” Williams %R Trading Series

The `WILLR` trading series represents Williams %R, a momentum indicator that measures overbought and oversold levels.

It is built upon the [Williams %R indicator](https://github.com/DrDanicka/trading_strategy_tester/blob/main/trading_strategy_tester/indicators/momentum/willr.py) implementation from the [indicators module](../indicators.md).

    source: SourceType = SourceType.CLOSE,
    length: int = 14
)
```

- **`source`** (`SourceType`): Price source for calculation. Default is `SourceType.CLOSE`. Supported sources are linked [here](../enums/source.md).
- **`length`** (`int`): Lookback period for the %R calculation. Default is 14.
