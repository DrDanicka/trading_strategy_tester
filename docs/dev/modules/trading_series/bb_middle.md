# `BB_MIDDLE` â€” Bollinger Band Middle (Basis) Trading Series

The `BB_MIDDLE` trading series represents the middle band (basis) of the Bollinger Bands, calculated as a moving average over a specified period.

It is built upon the [Bollinger Bands indicator](../../../../trading_strategy_tester/indicators/volatility/bb.py) implementation from the [indicators module](../indicators.md).

    offset: int = 0
)
