# `BB_MIDDLE` â€” Bollinger Band Middle (Basis) Trading Series

The `BB_MIDDLE` trading series represents the middle band (basis) of the Bollinger Bands, calculated as a moving average over a specified period.

It is built upon the [Bollinger Bands indicator](https://github.com/DrDanicka/trading_strategy_tester/blob/main/trading_strategy_tester/indicators/volatility/bb.py) implementation from the [indicators module](../indicators.md).

BB_MIDDLE(
    ticker: str,
    source: SourceType = SourceType.CLOSE,
    length: int = 20,
    ma_type: SmoothingType = SmoothingType.SMA,
    std_dev: float = 2,
    offset: int = 0
)
```

- **`ticker`** (`str`): Asset ticker symbol (e.g., `"AAPL"`).
