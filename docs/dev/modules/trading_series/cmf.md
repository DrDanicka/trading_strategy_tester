# `CMF` â€” Chaikin Money Flow Trading Series

The `CMF` trading series represents the Chaikin Money Flow indicator, which measures the volume-weighted average of accumulation and distribution over a specified period.

It is built upon the [Chaikin Money Flow indicator](https://github.com/DrDanicka/trading_strategy_tester/blob/main/trading_strategy_tester/indicators/volume/cmf.py) implementation from the [indicators module](../indicators.md).
