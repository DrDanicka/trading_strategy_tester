# `MASS_INDEX` â€” Mass Index Trading Series

The `MASS_INDEX` trading series measures the range expansion between high and low prices to identify potential reversals.

It is built upon the [Mass Index indicator](https://github.com/DrDanicka/trading_strategy_tester/blob/main/trading_strategy_tester/indicators/trend/mass.py) implementation from the [indicators module](../indicators.md).
