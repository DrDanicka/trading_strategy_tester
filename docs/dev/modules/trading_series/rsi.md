# `RSI` â€” Relative Strength Index Trading Series

The `RSI` trading series represents the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.

It is built upon the [RSI indicator](https://github.com/DrDanicka/trading_strategy_tester/blob/main/trading_strategy_tester/indicators/momentum/rsi.py) implementation from the [indicators module](../indicators.md).
